Mike Grimes -- Hangman Programming Challenge

I chose Ruby for its easy-to-use built in libraries for interacting with json
and issuing HTTP requests.

Assuming Ruby is already installed - (I used 1.8.7) - just navigate to the directory
with the Hangman.rb file and run `ruby Hangman.rb` to initiate a game
and watch the bot play.

As is, it only plays one game, then the program must be restarted by re-running
`ruby Hangman.rb`.

I actually never got it to win a game, but I know I'm pretty close to having a
pretty crappy AI that wins maybe 10-30% of its games. There's a small bug in how
the AI removes words that don't fit once we have a correct guess, but I wasn't
able to debug it completely before my time was up.

I wasn't able to implement names, this could be fixed by just loading
both the /usr/share/dict/words file along with the /usr/share/dict/propernames
file.

Final thing I know that I forgot was the use of apostrophes in words.

All that aside, thanks for the fun coding challenge!
